I am beginning my third year (fall 2022) as a Ph.D. student in criminal justice and criminology at Georgia State University. My research interests include policing and network analysis generally, and I hope to intersect the two fields to advance policing research. Outside of academia, I enjoy watching sports (specifically Braves baseball) and movies/tv shows and, when time permits, playing disc golf.

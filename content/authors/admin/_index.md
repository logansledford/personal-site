I am beginning my second year (fall 2021) as a Ph.D. student in criminal justice and criminology at Georgia State University. My research interests include policing generally, though specifically police stress and public/media criticism of police. In addition, I also enjoy researching rural-specific crime issues and the unique experiences of law enforcement personnel governing those areas.
